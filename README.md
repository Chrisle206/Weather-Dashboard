# Weather-Dashboard
This application allows the user to display current weather and future weather stats. The stats depend on where the user would like to search. The application saves the old searches and lists them out for the user to click on again just incase they would like to revisit the stats for those locations.

// ```
// GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
// WHEN I search for a city
// THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
// WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
// THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
// WHEN I view the UV index
// THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
// WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
// THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
// WHEN I click on a city in the search history
// THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
// ```
